<p style="text-aling: justify"> 
Student at <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/" style="font-style: italic;">Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica</a>, I have been working for three years as a research assistant at the university. I am related to communication, dissemination and research due to different outreach projects in which I have been involved. In addition, I am currently a Python teacher giving introductory data science classes for <a href="https://redbioma.github.io" style="font-style: italic;">redbioma.</a>


<br><br>
What I like most about my career is being able to help people with our knowledge. Part of my interests are the development of new technologies for people with disabilities and any other activity related to making a better world.

<br><br>
Some of my hobbies are cooking, playing music, learning new languages, reading manga and watching anime. :)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
