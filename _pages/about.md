<p style="text-aling: justify"> 
Student at <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/" style="font-style: italic;">Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica</a>, I have been working for three years as a research assistant at the university. I am related to communication, dissemination and research due to different outreach projects in which I have been involved. In addition, I am currently a Python teacher giving introductory data science classes for <a href="https://redbioma.github.io" style="font-style: italic;">redbioma.</a>


<br><br>
What I like most about my career is being able to help people with our knowledge. Part of my interests are the development of new technologies for people with disabilities and any other activity related to making a better world.

<br><br>
Some of my hobbies are cooking, playing music, learning new languages, reading manga and watching anime. :)
