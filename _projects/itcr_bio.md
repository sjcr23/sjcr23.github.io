ITCR Biodiversidad is a research and extension group of <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/">Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR)</a>, with an emphasis on biodiversity conservation. Created in 2021 by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f6nu6JAAAAAJ&hl=es">María Auxiliadora Mora Cross</a> and a group of female computer science students in order to contribute to biodiversity conservation.

<br><br>
<h2>Python Classes</h2>
Part of my work in this project has been to collaborate as a teacher. We gave a course on Introduction to Python for Data Science to female students of the <a href="https://www.utn.ac.cr/inicio">Universidad Técnica Nacional (UTN)</a> where I was able to share my knowledge learned in the area, as well as learn new skills and experiences in teaching.
<br><br>
<b>I had the opportunity to teach on the following topics:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Python Fundamentals</li>
    <li>Object Oriented Paradigm</li>
    <li>Data analysis with Pandas</li>
    <li>Vectors and arrays with Numpy</li>
    <li>Geospatial data with GeoPandas</li>
</ul>

Feel free to visit the "<a href="/teaching/">Teaching</a>" tab where I am gradually posting the course materials viewed.

<h2>CLEI 2024</h2>
Currently, I am co-developing a paper on the work we did with the UTN girls, which seeks to communicate about the perspective of university students on research in Data Science, biodiversity conservation, and gender gaps in computing.
<br>
<br>
This in order to present our work at the <a href="https://conferencia2024.clei.org/">50a Conferencia Latinoamericana de Informática (CLEI)</a>, which celebrates its fiftieth edition in Bahía Blanca, Argentina.
