ITCR Biodiversidad is a research and extension group of [Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR)](https://www.tec.ac.cr/), with an emphasis on biodiversity conservation. Part of my work in this project has been to collaborate as a teacher. We gave a course on Introduction to Python for Data Science to female students of the [Universidad Técnica Nacional (UTN)](https://www.utn.ac.cr/inicio) where I was able to share my knowledge learned in the area, as well as learn new skills and experiences in teaching.

I had the opportunity to teach on the following topics:

- Python Fundamentals
- Object Oriented Paradigm
- Data analysis with Pandas
- Vectors and arrays with Numpy
- Geospatial data with GeoPandas

Feel free to visit the "[Teaching](/teaching/)" tab where I am gradually posting the course materials viewed.
