<a href="https://redbioma.github.io">Red de Ciencia de datos para la Conservaci√≥n de la Biodiversidad Mesoamericana (redbioma)</a> is a network of Mesoamerican researchers committed to biodiversity conservation, who seek to contribute to the world through information technologies. Redbioma has the objective of proposing solutions to conservation problems through data science, with a strong component of capacity building and empowerment of women in the region.

<h2>Web development</h2>

In my work related to redbioma I was able to put into practice the knowledge I learned throughout my university education by setting up a web site for the network. It was made with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">JeKyll</a>, a free framework that has integration with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which makes it a solid option for the creation of static websites. Since a few months ago I have been in charge of maintaining the website, updating information and creating ways for the network to show the work done.

Feel free to see the website I was able to develop here: <a href="https://redbioma.github.io">https://redbioma.github.io</a>

<h2>Python classes</h2>
I am currently developing with other colleagues a free Python for Data Science course for redbioma, a course that will be given to people from all over Mesoamerica, more information here: <a href="https://redbioma.github.io/cursos/python-ciencia-datos.html">Python for Data Science course program.</a>
