## Project with Erizo Juan Santamaría 
\\
In LabExp I worked on the development, research, and design of new inclusive methodologies to apply them in a [project with the Erizo](https://www.tec.ac.cr/hoyeneltec/2022/09/12/erizo-juan-santamaria-aparece-mapa-nombres-elegidos-sus-habitantes) Juan Santamaría community, which seeks to strengthen and support the community resilience by facilitating the risk management. 

Part of my responsibilities were administrative, communicative and diffusion tasks of different Lab’s open source projects. Part of them were: writing news, making infographics, websites testing and many other things related to the Lab’s projects.

Feel free to read this article I wrote about the importance of the [infrastructure mobility conditions that every neighborhood should have.](https://www.tec.ac.cr/noticias/cuales-deberian-ser-condiciones-infraestructura-movilidad-nuestros-barrios)
